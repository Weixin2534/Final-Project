# Scientific Question

The connection between the coastal northeastern United States (NEUS) warming and Northwest Atlantic Shelf (NWS) warming.

# Analysis Plan

- Identify warming trends of the coastal NEUS in surface air temperature (SAT) and the NWS in sea surface temperature (SST).
- Identify spacial patterns of SAT trends in the coastal NEUS and SST trends in the NWS.
- Analyze the relationship between the coastal NEUS and the NWS warming trends using correlation maps
- Explore other possible factors like Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) that may be associated with the coastal NEUS warming.
